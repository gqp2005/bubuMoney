# Patch Notes

## v1.0

- Added notifications page and per-user read status, with TTL-based cleanup (requires Firestore TTL on `expiresAt`).
- Reworked transactions calendar + list layout and search sheet (type, date presets, range).
- Linked new/edit transactions to return to the edited date on the calendar.
- Updated memos to support multiple entries with per-entry delete and date/time display.
- Added settings tools: category link, payment methods editor page, and data reset options.
